Epuber is simple tool to compile and pack source files into EPUB format. Offers to define multiple "targets" which allows to create multiple versions of the book by running only one command. Eliminates copying code and information, eliminates needs to use _git_ branches to differ ebook content.


## Features

Simple example of `.bookspec` file defining all book's metadata and Table Of Contents. This file can be generated by running command `epuber init`.

```ruby
Epuber::Book.new do |book|
  book.title = 'Epuber example book'
  book.author = 'Roman Kříž'
  book.isbn = '123-45-67890-12-3'
  book.version = '1.0.1'
  book.build_version = '5'

  book.cover_image = 'cover'
  book.add_default_style 'default_style.styl'

  # create spine and toc
  book.toc do |toc|
    toc.file 'cover', :landmark_cover
    toc.file 'copyright', :landmark_copyright
    toc.file 'toc', :landmark_toc

    toc.file 'intro', 'Intro'

    toc.file 'chapter_01', 'Chapter One' do
      toc.file '#section_01', 'Section One, awesome'
      toc.file '#section_02', 'Section Two, more awesome'
      toc.file '#section_03', 'Section Three, wow, much, very'
    end

    toc.file 'conclusion', 'Conclusion'

    toc.file 'footnotes', 'Footnotes', linear: false
  end

  # load basic validators folder with ruby scripts
  book.use 'basic_validators/'
end
```

Except for paths to plugins `book.use`, every path could be only name of the file, even without extension. So you can rename them, move them, the correct path will always resolved. Only exception is when the same name has more then one file.
